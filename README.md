# week-5-programe
This reprository aim to share some annalysis dataset.

From this dataset, I have identified the following patterns:
1. Single young individuals are more likely to accept coupons when traveling alone or without children in the car.
2. People's choice of restaurant correlates directly with their income level.
3. Individuals heading to work are more likely to decline coupons.

This week's learning tasks pose a significant challenge for me, and I hope the teacher can spend some time explaining them.
